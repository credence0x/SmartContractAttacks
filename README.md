# Smart Contract Attacks
Reimplementing smart contract vulnerabilities and attacking them to aid understanding

Each individual bug can be found in the `/src/` folder with the name of each folder<br>
being the name of the attack/bug. The tests can also be found in the same folder.<br>

Note that different solidity versions are used per attack.<br>

## SETUP

- install foundry - https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md
- to build: $`forge build` <br>
- to test: $`forge test` . Use $`forge test -vvvv` to see trace errors and how attacks are played (especially for reentrancy attacks) <br>
